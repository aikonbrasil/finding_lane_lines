### Reflection

### 1. Describe your pipeline. As part of the description, explain how you modified the draw_lines() function.
In order to complete with the project targets, it was created 3 similar functions that were called as: line_recognition(), line_recognition2(), and line_recognition3(). In following lines is described in detail each of these functions.

#### line_recognition()

This is the master pipeline that is consisted of the next steps:
- Transformation of raw image to grayscale using grayscale(img) helper function
- Defining a kernel size and applying Gaussian smoothing using the gaussian_blur(img, kernel_size) helper function
- Defining parameters for Canny using canny(img, low_threshold, high_threshold) helper funtion
- Creating masked edges image using region_of_interest helper function 
- Defining the Hough transform parameters using hough_lines(img, rho, theta, threshold, min_line_len, max_line_gap) helper function. This hough_lines function plot the lines using the draw_lines(img, lines, color=[255, 0, 0], thickness=2) helper function.
- Draw the lines on the edge image

The next pictures are result of the pipeline described before:

### line_recognition2()

This function is an optimization of line_recognition() function, this optimization was done in order to achieve target defined for video detection line(right_side road lines and yellow_left_side road lines). Basically we added a new pipeline to the function draw_lines(). It was saved with the name draw_lines2(). draw_lines2() is characterized by the next features:
- Calculating slope and intersection for every line that was identified by Hough transform.
- Lines are clusterized in two groups: left_lines and right_lines, it was done using the slope information.
- In order to decrease noise in slope and intersection, we used a filter based on mean and standard deviation metrics that correspond to every line indentified in each frame. This metrics where used to filter lines that follow the next rule: mean(slope)-slope < std(slope). In this case mean(slope) is the mean of all lines detected by Hough transform in actual frame, slope is metric that corresponds to the an specific line that is being evaluated, and std(slope) is the standard deviation of all slopes detected in actual frame.
- In order to take advantage of old information of previous frames, it was applied a weight average between actual slope and intersection. For example, in the case of the slope we considered the next relationship: mean_m_right = np.mean(vector_m_right)*0.2 + m_history_right*0.8. In this case we priorized history information of previous frames.

### line_recognition3()

In order to achieve the challenge, we inserted extra modifications to line_recognition2() function. The features that were added are:
- Filtering slopes that are near zero, in order to avoid horizontal verticals that are abundant in the video challenge.
- Using some exceptions in cases in which some variables generate NaN values.

### 2. Identify potential shortcomings with your current pipeline


One potential shortcoming would be in case the camera that generate the video is located in other position on the car. So, maybe in this case, my pipeline will not be capable to define automatically the mask used in the script.

Another shortcoming could be when some shadow appears in the road or maybe in case the road line are not easily visible.

In the case of the Challenge video, I have used slope information to filter horizontal lines. In this case, it was done a manual definition of slope values to filter specific lines. Ideally it should be done automatically, maybe using some artificial intelligent algorithm.


### 3. Suggest possible improvements to your pipeline

A possible improvement would be to create an specific function in order to define vertices that define the mask automatically.

Another potential improvement could be to create a function that calibrate automatically the Hough Transform parameters.

Other important improvement to solve the Challenge video could be to create an artificial intelligence algorithm to define slopes that will filter horizontal lines.
